# EDA-with-Python-Goodreads-Data

THIS IS THE FIRST HOMEWORK OF THE DATA SCIENCE AND PYTHON BY DATAI TEAM

The code here is rather simple as I am a beginner at Python.

With the Goodread data I will try to explore the book data in Goodreads and visualize the rating, reviews and number of page and find out if there is any correlation between these characteristics. The reason I have choose this dataset is my reading passion. This exercise will also help me to discover new books.
